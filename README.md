## Overview

Here, we aim to improve the quality of the video sequence provided above. This is a
video recording of a highway during night. Most of the Computer Vision pipelines for
lane detection or other self-driving tasks require good lighting conditions and
color information for detecting good features. A lot of pre-processing is required in such scenarios
where lighting conditions are poor.
